# Lichess-User-Search

This is a website, which can provide any information about any lichess player. You just have to type a nickname of lichess player. Huge thanks to https://github.com/Tevajs, I was inspired by his LichessInfoChecker and decided to convert it into the website.

The website is based on fetch requests. When you enter the username of the player you want to get information about, the website makes a fetch request to the lichess server, inserting your entered username into the request link.
